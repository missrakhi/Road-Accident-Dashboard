# Road Accident Dashboard

##  Problem Statemnet:
The dashboard presents a problem related to road safety, indicating a high number of road accidents leading to casualties. The data could be used to identify patterns and areas that require improvement to reduce accident rates.


## Steps Taken
### 1.	Data Cleaning:
 In this step, the data was cleaned by removing inconsistencies, errors, and duplicates. The goal was to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data for further analysis. Example- Replaced Fetal to Fatal in Accident_Severity Column, Replaced Auto traffic sig to Auto traffic signal in Junction_Control Column 

### 2.	Data Processing: 
New columns were created to organize, sort, and filter the data for extracting meaningful insights. Example- Add a column of Month by applying formula =TEXT(B2,"MMMM"), Add a column of Year by applying formula =TEXT(B23,"MMMM") 

### 3.	Data Visualization: 
Excel was utilized as a visualization tool to create attractive charts, graphs, and interactive visuals for presenting the data in an easily understandable manner.

### 4.	Dashboard Creation: 
Finally, a dashboard was built in Excel by incorporating slicers and timelines, enabling users to interact with the data and explore different perspectives.

### 5.	Hyperlinks: 
Included clickable objects to navigate seamlessly between different dashboard pages or locations.

## Key Insights:
### Total Casualties Analysis : 
The total number of casualties that occurred after accidents is a staggering 417,883.

### Casualties Severity Distribution: 
The majority of casualties are slight (84.1%), but there is a significant number of serious (14.2%) and fatal casualties (1.7%), which highlights the need for targeted interventions.

### Vehicle Type Involvement: 
Cars are involved in the highest number of total casualties, indicating that passenger vehicles may be a critical area for improving safety measures.

### Monthly Trend Analysis: 
In the years 2021 and 2022, the total casualties were 222,146 and 195,737, respectively. Analyzing the trends between these two years provides valuable insights for targeted interventions.

### Geographical Variation: 
More casualties occur in urban areas compared to rural areas, which could be due to higher traffic volumes or different driving behaviors in these settings.

### Road Type Risks: 
Single carriageways have the highest number of total casualties, which could indicate that these road types have inherent safety risks or higher traffic flows that need to be addressed.

### Lighting Conditions: 
A significant number of casualties occur during daylight, which is counterintuitive as one might expect higher casualties during darker conditions. This could indicate other factors at play, such as higher traffic volumes during the day.

### Weather Conditions: 
Most casualties occur in clear weather conditions, suggesting that driver behavior and other road conditions may have a larger impact on safety than weather conditions alone.

### Road Surface Conditions: 
Wet road conditions contribute to the highest number of casualties compared to dry or snow/ice conditions, emphasizing the need for better road maintenance and driver education on handling wet roads.
