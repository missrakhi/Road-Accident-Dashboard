# Road Accident Dashboard

##  Problem Statemnet:
The dashboard presents a problem related to road safety, indicating a high number of road accidents leading to casualties. The data could be used to identify patterns and areas that require improvement to reduce accident rates.


## Here's a sneak peek the steps I followed:
### 🧹 1. Data Collection & Cleaning: 
Ensured data integrity by addressing missing values and inconsistencies.
### 📋 2. Data Preprocessing: 
Created new columns like Month, Year, and   Day from the date column to help visualize monthly trends and facilitate analysis.
### 📊 3. Data Visualization:

#### •	📊 Primary KPIs: 
Used pivot tables and donut charts to showcase the total casualties post-accidents, providing a quick overview.

#### •	🚗 Casualties by Accident Severity and Vehicle Type:
 Consolidated road types and visualized casualties using calculated fields, creating pivot tables to highlight the impact of accident severity and vehicle types.

#### •	📅 Monthly Trend Analysis: 
Presented trends over time with a line chart, allowing us to compare casualties between 2021 and 2022 on a monthly basis.

#### •	🛣️ Casualties by Road Type: 
Utilized a bar graph to identify road types associated with the highest casualties, enabling us to prioritize safety measures accordingly.

#### •	🌊 Casualties by Road Surface: 
Employed a tree map chart to show the distribution of casualties based on road surface conditions, shedding light on the impact of road conditions on accidents.
#### •	🌆 Distribution of Casualties by Area/Location & by Day/Night: 
Created donut charts to showcase the distribution of casualties based on location (urban vs. rural) and time of day (day vs. night), helping us understand accident patterns.

#### •	Road Surface Conditions: 
Wet road conditions contribute to the highest number of casualties compared to dry or snow/ice conditions, emphasizing the need for better road maintenance and driver education on handling wet roads.

### 🔄 4. Slicers: 
Added slicers for dynamic data analysis, allowing users to explore the data from various angles and granularity levels. 

### 🔗 5. Hyperlinks: 
Included clickable objects to navigate seamlessly between different dashboard pages or locations.
